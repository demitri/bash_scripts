# Use "%C" instead of "%r@%h:%p" for the ControlPath.
# This uses a hashed value based on the host, user, hostname. and port
# instead of the literal values. This is useful when very
# long host names exceed a length limit. This is valid
# for OpenSSH 6.7+ (Oct 2014).
#
# Also, don't choose /tmp for ControlPath for security reasons!
# Make the 'connections' directory chmod 700 -> "chmod 700 connections"

# X11 forwarding:
# -X == ForwardX11
# -Y == ForwardX11Trusted <-- implies "-X"

# To disable ControlPath for a particular host, add this:
# ControlPath none

# Example, configure to taste.
#Host <nickname>
#	User <username>
#	Port 22
#	Hostname <host or ip>
#	IdentityFile <use only this private SSH key>
#	IdentitiesOnly yes # do not attempt to authenticate with a password, only SSH keys
#	LocalForward <local port> 127.0.0.1:<remote port> # automatically forward this port
#   ForwardAgent no
#
#   If a gateway is needed:
#   ProxyJump <configured gateway server> # use nickname of server previously configured
#   LogLevel QUIET # useful to quiet chatty gateway machines
